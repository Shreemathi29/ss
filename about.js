      }}>When you read a book, you use your brain very actively because reading is a very active
         process. When a writer does a lot of work, even the reader also works hard. When you read
          something from an English book, you either imagine a scene in your head, or understand 
          clearly what the writer is trying to say and choose to agree or disagree with the writer.
           Reading is relaxing as it takes your mind off the present work pressure. Reading allows
            you to increase your intelligence, become more creative, access inexpensive
             entertainment, and find a way to reduce stress. You can get endless
              benefits from reading a book.
         Let’s find some more reasons to read books.</p>

         1. Help you develop a habit of thinking in English

Thinking in English is vital in order to develop a natural English fluency. Reading English 
books might just restrict your thinking in native language and facilitate thinking in English.
 When you develop an ability to read in English quite fast, your mind simply doesn’t have time
  for the translation process.

When you become a fluent reader, your eyes scan the text allowing you to think in English.
 It’s quite impossible for your brain to manage two processes at the same time, i.e., reading
  in English and thinking in your native language.

2. Helps you learn new vocabulary

Reading a book will help you find new words. Just by reading and understanding its meaning
 from the context, you can build quite a large passive English vocabulary. You can use those
  new words while speaking with other English speakers. To achieve that, you have to practice
   speaking English with yourself or others, 
so that you can develop natural ability to speak effortlessly and fluently.
